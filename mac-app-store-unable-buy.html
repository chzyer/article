mac app store无法购买软件
<p>想买trine2但是当按下buy app的时候， 提示
<code>It may be damaged or was not signed</code>
但是购买其他则没问题。
然后搜到了一个答案， </p>

<pre><code>I had the same problem on a MacBook Air that ships with Lion

This is how you fix it

Close Every App (Safari, iTunes, AppStore, etc)
Launch Finder
Press CMD+SHIFT+G (or click on Go then Go To Folder)
Type the following /var/folders
Open up Console (Spotlight Console and launch it)
Open The AppStore
Try to buy something free and you will see this message "The product distribution file could not be verified. It may be damaged or was not signed."
Switch to Console and look at the error message
</code></pre>

<p>然后我查看log， 发现是yy这个文件夹， 删除即可</p>
